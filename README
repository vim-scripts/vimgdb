This script provides an emacs like GDB interface to vim. Woks in cygwin and unix terminals (no need for +clientserver).

Find the screen shots at "Vim Viki"

Start the program like this

vimgdb <gdb-params> <exe-file> <exe-params>

This will open vim with two windows. Type the gdb commands in bottom window. The top window will show the current file line and breakpoints highlighted.

You can also jump to top window and use the following keys
<F6> run
<F5> continue
<F7> step into
<F8> step over
<F9> toggle break point
Ctr-p Watch the variable under Cursor/Visual selection

watch the output/variables in bottom window.

Known Bugs:
Don't use the quit gdb command (that will hang the vim), instead quit the vim.
